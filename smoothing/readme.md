Smoothing with a moving average is a common technique used to reduce noise in time series data. In the context of machine learning, if the predictions of a model are somewhat noisy, applying a moving average smoothing can be a useful approach to reduce the impact of noise and better understand the underlying trends.

Moving average smoothing involves computing the average of a sliding window of a certain number of observations, which "smooths out" the series by reducing the fluctuations that occur at a small scale. The larger the window, the more smoothing occurs, but the more information is lost as well. Finding the appropriate window size can be a balancing act between reducing noise and preserving relevant information.

We explore this technique in this subfolder. 

To evaluate whether smoothing with a moving average improves the performance of a machine learning model, you can compare the accuracy of the original model predictions with the accuracy of the smoothed predictions. If the smoothed predictions are more accurate, it may suggest that the original model was sensitive to noise, and that the smoothing helped to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
